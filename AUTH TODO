login

we are using the default login/logout views provided by django.contrib.auth [so we don't have to implement our own.]

That being said, here's what they do:

Login renders a template at registration/login.html by default, and is urlconf-d for accounts/login by default. The redirect is handled with the next parameter.
logout renders a template at registration/logged_out.html by default and the redirect is handled inside.
registration is your own view by default, and renders a template at registration/register.html


We need to decide on a pageflow: There isn't going to be an index anymore, if you try to hit our site, you'll be redirected to your player profile page.  That's auth required, so it will redirect to a login page if you aren't logged in.  Once you log-in successfully, that should redirect to YOUR player page.

So we need to figure out how to get all of these redirects right.
We need to figure out how to do the navbar properly and have all pages inherit from it.
We need to construct all of the views properly.
We need to figure out how to do the user_passes_test stuff.

Here's what we want to do:
    If you hit www.pingpong.com and you're not logged in, we want it to prompt for your login.
    In fact, if you hit any garbage page, we'll simply redirect you to / and it will ask you to login and prompt you to register
    Then it will redirect to your player profile.

Right now:
    Let's do user_passes_test and user related stuff for now.
