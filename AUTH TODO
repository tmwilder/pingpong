we are using the default login/logout views provided by django.contrib.auth [so we don't have to implement our own.]

Here's what they do:

Login renders a template at registration/login.html by default, and is urlconf-d for accounts/login by default. The redirect is handled with the next parameter.
logout renders a template at registration/logged_out.html by default and the redirect is handled inside.
registration is your own view by default, and renders a template at registration/register.html


The main gaps atm are:
    1) It's unclear that all of the views work as advertised for things that aren't profiles
    2) For those that do, authorization does not exist to prevent access to views.


Okay, so an auth decorator has been created.  We need to finish constructing views, and then we need to appropriately decorate all authorized views.
An example is on the user_profile view, though it should be removed.
We also might want to add a "you were not authorized page", so it's a bit more obvious that something happened.
