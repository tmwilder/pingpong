This document is a list of features we want, questions we need to answer, and minor bugs. Ordering is arbitrary.

Questions:
1. How should we allow commissioners to add teams? The issue is that a string doesn't uniquely identify a team. Is there a slick page flow to solve this problem?

Pages to create:
1. Sign up page/create player.
2. player_profile/update_player page.
3. team_profile/update_team.
4. league_profile/update_league.
5. view_matches.
6. match_profile/update_matches.


Features:
1. Make all table elements that refer to team, match, league, or player links to a profile page.
2. Choose a suitable CSS skin and implement.
3. Add javascript form validation.
4. Spec out content management/authentication.
5. Implement content management/authentication.
6. Add unit tests.
7. Planned refactor.
8. Set up seperate dev, test, production environments.
9. Modify all post request pages to take their input as parameters and execute the post request. I.E. update_team.
10. Search bar for navigation.
11. Email link invite system.
12. Place on limits on user creation to prevent spam/cheating.
