This document is a list of features we want, questions we need to answer, and minor bugs. Ordering is arbitrary.

Questions:
1. How should we allow commissioners to add teams? The issue is that a string doesn't uniquely identify a team. Is there a slick page flow to solve this problem?


Pages to create:
1. player_profile/update_player page. Needs update player.
2. team_profile/update_team. Needs update team.
3. match_profile/update_matches.


Features:
1. Choose a suitable CSS skin and implement.
2. Add javascript form validation.
3. Add unit tests.
4. Planned refactor.
5. Set up seperate dev, test, production environments.
6. Modify all post request pages to take their input as parameters and execute the post request. I.E. update_team.
7. Search bar for navigation.
8. Email link invite system.
9. Place on limits on user creation to prevent spam/cheating.


Bugs:
1. The fixture generation script puts all matches in league1.
