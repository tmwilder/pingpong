We are using the default login/logout views provided by django.contrib.auth

Login renders a template at registration/login.html by default.
It is urlconf-d for accounts/login by default. [login_required decorator expects it there]
When you are routed to login, the current URL is passed to login within the next parameter, and will redirect there afterward.
If you hit accounts/login directly, you will redirect according to the value set in settings.py [currently '/']

logout renders a template at registration/logged_out.html by default.
The redirect is handled by passing the 'next_page' parameter in urls.py

Registration must be a custom written view.
It renders a template at registration/register.html
We use the django provided UserCreationForm to do our registration

For authorization, we drop login_required decorators on all of our views.
Moreover, we have written a custom user_passes_test decorator which utilizes the entire request.
These are found in decorators.py
